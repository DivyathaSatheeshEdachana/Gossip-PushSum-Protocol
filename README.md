## Working Part :

<ul>
<li>The program runs correctly for full, line, 2D and Imp2D network topologies.</li>
<li>Gossip and Push-sum protocol for the above mentioned topologies are implemented and working as expected.</li>
<li>The program can effectively give feedback on how much time the system took to converge for each of the algorithm.</li>
<li>Time taken to converge is given in milliseconds and will be printed on the screen as well as graphs for all the topoligies for each algorithm are plotted.</li>
</ul>

## Largest network managed to deal with for each type of topology and algorithm :

### Gossip :-

<ul>
<li>Full : </li>
<li>Line : </li>
<li>2D : </li>
<li>Imp2D : </li>
</ul>

### Push Sum :-

<ul>
<li>Full : </li>
<li>Line : </li>
<li>2D : </li>
<li>Imp2D : </li>
</ul>
