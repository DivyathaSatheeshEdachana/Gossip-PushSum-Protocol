## Working Part :

The program runs correctly for full, line, 2D and Imp2D network topologies.
Gossip and Push-sum protocol for the above mentioned topologies are implemented and working as expected.
The program can effectively give feedback on how much time the system took to converge for each of the algorithm. Time taken to converge is given in milliseconds and will be printed on the screen as well as graphs for all the topoligies for each algorithm are plotted.

## Largest network managed to deal with for each type of topology and algorithm :

### Gossip :-

<ul>
<li>Full : </li>
<li>Line : </li>
<li>2D : </li>
<li>Imp2D : </li>
</ul>

### Push Sum :-

<ul>
<li>Full : </li>
<li>Line : </li>
<li>2D : </li>
<li>Imp2D : </li>
</ul>
